# Advanced_Notepad
Unlike Windows conventional Notepad, this one is a bit advanced.
It supports multiple files simultaneously managed systematically in multiple tabs.
Font styles can be changed, including colors.
Support several shortcuts to ease your work.
Supports any document with utf-8 enconding, thus is NOT limited to just a plain text editor.
Easily resize your window size which fits you.
Can rename your file from within app itself using saveas.
Can drictly print your work without help of any other app.
Few features are still to add, work in progress... :)

Any further suggestions to improve the app are heartly welcomed :)

{PS: If you want to run the app without installing python in your machine than you need pyinstaller to convert the notepad_runnable.py file into .exe file }
